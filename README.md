This is a framework and wrapper for the SFML library that makes creating games easier.

As of right now, there is no documentation. I've been pretty busy, and so I may never get around to adding documentation for it.

It is pretty much required that you use the following compilers, because the static libraries included were compiled with MinGW 7.3.0 and MinGW 9.2.0

(This is MinGW32 + MinGW64 7.3.0)

I have yet to upload MinGW 9.2.0
