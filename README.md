# Engine
This is a framework and wrapper for the SFML library that makes creating games easier.

As of right now, there is no documentation. I've been pretty busy, and so I may never get around to adding documentation for it. I periodically update this Engine when I have time. I hope it's useful to someone!

It is required that you use the same compilers that I have. This is because the static libraries included are pre-compiled with MinGW 7.3.0 and MinGW 9.2.0
I have uploaded these compilers that I use to make it easy for anyone having difficulty getting the right compiler.

Here you can download either MinGW 7.3.0 or MinGW 9.2.0

(64bit and 32bit compilers are packaged together per MinGW version)
