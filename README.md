# Engine
This is a framework and wrapper for the SFML library that makes creating games easier.

As of right now, there is no documentation. I've been pretty busy, and so I may never get around to adding documentation for it. I periodically update this Engine when I have time. I hope it's useful to someone!

It is required that you use the same compilers that I have. This is because the static libraries included are pre-compiled with Mingw GCC 10.2.0

Download Mingw GCC 10.2.0 32bit and 64bit:
https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/tag/10.2.0-11.0.0-9.0.0-r3



For older versions:
I still have the 9.2.0 and 7.3.0 compilers that I used to compile previous versions of this library.
To make it easy for anyone having difficulty getting the right compiler, you can download the older versions below.

Here you can download either Mingw GCC 7.3.0 or Mingw GCC 9.2.0 for backwards compatibility:

(64bit and 32bit compilers are packaged together per MinGW version)
